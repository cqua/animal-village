# Animal Village
## Core Concept
You are a new resident in a village.
## Pillars:
### Family
### Friendship
### Community
## Setting
The game takes place in a village with the following features:
### Town Center
A clearing for npcs to wander and for players to access the other buildings in the village. Mainly a transitional area where you are likely to find other villagers. Some bugs spawn here too.
### Shop
A building for buying and selling. The player can buy a bugnet, a watering can, seeds, medicine, and one random piece of furniture selected each morning. The player can sell any item. Closes at night.
### NPC Houses
Each npc villager has a house with a few pieces of furniture, including a bed. This is where you will find them in the morning or evening. If they are sick, they will stay in bed all day. Closes at night.
### Flower Field
An area with flower beds. The villagers can plant and water flowers here. Weeds will grow periodically and can be weeded out. Flowers have hp and will die if it is drained. Flowers lose hp by being stepped on, being left unwatered for a day, being near a weed. Bugs spawn here.
### Forest
A collection of trees away from the houses. Bugs and artifacts spawn here.
### Waterside
A beach by the water. Artifacts spawn here.
### Playerâ€™s Home
A house similar to the npc houses. The player has the freedom to place furniture here.
## Time
The game has a cycle for day and night. 1 hour in game passes every 90 seconds, and a full day is 36 minutes. The shop is open from 8:00 - 20:00. Time also affects villagers' schedules dependent on their personality, and what bugs are out.
## Villagers
Villagers are the heart of the game.

#### Relationship Values
Each npc villager has a relationship to player value (RVP) which measures how good friends you are on a scale 0-100. Each interaction has an RVP range it is able to happen in. Many interactions also affect RVP. RVP starts at 10 and degrades by 1 each day.
### Interactions
#### Chatting
Villagers have a few randomized lines of dialog each day based on friendship and recent events.

RPV +1.
#### Ask Favor
Once a day, a villager can ask the player for a favor. This has a random chance to trigger when chatting. This may also be triggered if the player is standing nearby, causing the villager to approach.

Favors can take the following forms:
##### Quiz
Will ask you a question that may relate to:
- Their hobby
- Their feelings on another villager
- Recent events

RVP change depends on how much they like your answer, within a range of (-1,+2)
##### Delivery
Will give the player an item to deliver to another villager.

RVP +3 if successful
##### Request
Will ask for an item related to their hobby, or Medicine if sick

RVP +3

Bonus points for quality of item
#### Gift Giving
Villagers have a chance to gift the player items, usually furniture. The probability and quality depend on RPV. The probability also increases when players pick up trash and plant flowers.
#### Gift Receiving
After chatting with a villager, the player can choose an item from their inventory to gift away.

RVP change depends on how liked the gift is, which depends on personality, hobby, item quality, and if they already own the item.
#### Bother
If the player does something that bothers a villager, they will be bothered and chastise the player.

Actions that bother villagers are:
- hitting with tool - RVP -1
- being pushed - RVP -1
- talking too many times in quick succession - RVP -1
- stepping on flowers (flower hobby only) - RVP -1
- scaring bugs (bug hobby only) - RVP -1
- failing a delivery favor - RVP -2

RVP loss increases exponentially each time bothered in a single day
